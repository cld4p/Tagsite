Tagsite Pack is a seperate file that need not be uncluded within the datapacks folder, its mainly a folder containing the resources of the game
use a resource pack url and add it within the resource pack within it, use mcpacks and upload the tagsite_pack, copy the link to the server.properties

Put the rest of the contents in the datapack folder, there is also a dedicated JAR file that should be put in the plugins folder

PLay WEll!
